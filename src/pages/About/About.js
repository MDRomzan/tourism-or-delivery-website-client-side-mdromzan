            To put it quite simply, a course outline is a map of the knowledge you’ll include in your course. It shows where you will begin and where you will end. It also lists out all the major steps you will take in between. graphic showing start, steps, and end
            
            Most course outlines contain a few standard components.

            The main structure of your outline will consist of modules, lessons, and topics since these are the basic building blocks of your online course.

            You can use these as your basic building blocks and expand beneath them to dig deeper into each topic.

            This course outline is also where you start to develop your framework for success. The best eLearning courses follow a system or conceptual framework that helps learners see where they’re going and is easy to follow. At each level, the framework contains more information about the topic at hand.

            An example of this is as follows:


           </p>
           <h3>
               Module 1: Service
            </h3>
            <p>Topic 1: Why choose Facebook marketing.
            By using the modules, lessons, and topics for each new idea, you will develop a framework that is simple for your learner to follow.
            
            Alternatively, you can use just modules and lessons if you don’t need the topics. I’ve created many courses this way, but there are some topics that have required all three components.

            Modules, lessons, and topics (if you need them) break up the content into easily digestible sections. They make the course easier to follow and allow learners to easily refer back to specific parts of the course if they need to.  Breaking up the content also helps learners determine the expectations for each section.

            Breaking up your content into smaller bites also makes instruction easier especially if you’re considering utilizing microlearning. Students appreciate smaller bites of content. Ultimately, they will be more likely to consume your content which will increase the learning outcomes for your course.
